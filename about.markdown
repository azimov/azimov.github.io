I am a British data and software guy currently living in Whistler, BC.
I work for the epidemiology group at Janssen Pharmacuiticals writing open source software that helps us better understand diseases using observational health data.
Previously, I worked in systems and synthetic biology at the University of Nottingham where I completed my PhD and a 4 year post doc.
We designed microbes to produce chemicals like biofeuls or flavours.
Naturally, any opinions posted here are my own.

I like to ski, run, bike and many other outdoor things.
